# OpenGL-Cuboid-Diorama
 Final assignment under theme "Recreation" for a university course which taught the basics of graphics programming, OpenGL, and GLSL using the LearnOpenGL book.  
 This is a 3D diorama which was, as per the assignment specification, constructed and animated using only transformed cuboids.  
 The scene has an interactive animation that plays when the R-key is pressed, and the camera can be controlled with the mouse.  
 More detailed information on the construction of the individual objects in the scene can be read in the CG_Assignment_2_Report.pdf file.
